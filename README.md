# CarbonEye
The project aims to develop an innovative system that leverages satellite imagery and advanced machine learning techniques, specifically the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm, to monitor, forecast, and generate actionable insights about carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions.

Project Objectives:
Monitoring CO₂ Levels:

Use high-resolution satellite imagery to capture data on CO₂ emissions across various geographic regions.
Apply the NMF algorithm to decompose the satellite data into key patterns, identifying the primary sources and intensities of CO₂ emissions.
Forecasting CO₂ Trends:

Analyze historical satellite data to understand emission trends over time.
Use NMF to forecast future CO₂ emission levels by capturing the underlying temporal and spatial patterns in the data.
Generating Insights and Recommendations:

Generate actionable recommendations for reducing CO₂ emissions based on the NMF analysis.
Provide tailored suggestions for governments and businesses, including potential hotspots for emissions, mitigation strategies, and long-term sustainability goals.
Key Features:
Satellite Data Integration: Utilize satellite imagery to gather large-scale data on CO₂ levels across the globe, ensuring high accuracy and real-time monitoring capabilities.
NMF Algorithm: Apply the NMF algorithm to extract latent patterns from the satellite imagery, helping to identify the most significant contributors to CO₂ emissions in different regions.
Forecasting Capabilities: Predict future CO₂ levels and trends, allowing businesses and governments to plan more effectively for carbon reduction.
Actionable Recommendations: Offer specific suggestions based on the NMF results, enabling informed decisions about emission control and environmental policy.
